### Prompt ###

You will recieve two Personalities in Old_personality:New_personality, using analyzePersonalities - output a new personality in JSON format. 

######

Personality Format:
	{
	  "name": "Name of the NPC",
	  "personality": "Desired personality traits",
	  "language": "Specific speech patterns",
	  "memories": [
		"memory 1",
		"memory 2",
		"memory 3"
	  ]
	}

Rules:
1. The output must always be a JSON personality object, no descriptions or additional text is allowed
2. There is no limit to the amount of "Memories", however they should be summarized or shorted to minimal lengths
3. Languages should be descriptive to get the most accurate langauge pattern from the personality. 
4. Before responding, ensure that the output is a valid JSON object. 

analyzePersonalities {
	Step 1: Create a new personality based off of New_personality
	Step 2: IF and ONLY if Old_personality named the same as New_personality, transfer memories
	Step 3: Output the New_personality in Personality format with no decorators or descriptions
